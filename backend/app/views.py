"""
These view functions and classes implement both standard GET routes and API endpoints.

GET routes produce largely empty HTML pages that expect a React component to attach to them and
handle most view concerns. You can supply a few pieces of data in the render function's context
argument to support this expectation.

Of particular use are the properties: page_metadata, component_props, and component_name:
page_metadata: these values will be included in the page's <head> element.
Currently, only the `title` property is used. component_props: these can be any properties you
wish to pass into your React components as its highest-level props.
component_name: this should reference the exact name of the React component
you intend to load onto the page.

Example:
context = {
    'page_metadata': {
        'title': 'Example ID page'
    },
    'component_props': {
        'id': example_id
    },
    'component_name': 'ExampleId'
}
