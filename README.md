# Lagos PC BOOM!

Go to https://urop.dhmit.xyz/sonification/
And follow the steps (substituting `sonification` for `lagos-pc-boom`)
We don't have a frontend server, so only follow the backend instructions. And ask @anastasia if you get stuck!

Once backend is set up and running on port :8000, you will want to create a superuser, which will allow you to use the admin interface. 
Open a terminal window:
```
cd lagos
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
You can set it to something simple like 
username: admin
email: admin@example.com
password: password

This is just for development purposes!
